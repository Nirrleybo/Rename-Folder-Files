# Rename-Folder-Files
Java script code to change all sub folders and files name so u could delete it. 
fight against window "the source filename are larger than is supported by the file system" error !!

This script does not delete files \ folders! it will only change the folder & files names of the parent folder content.
The idea is to change all the files and folders names so we could be able to delete it.

Make sure u have node install.

1. download the js file.
2. run it:

RUN:

       example: $ node delete_folder.js C:\folder_root_to_delete
       
       
After the script is done - u can go ahead and delete the main folder.

Cheers!
